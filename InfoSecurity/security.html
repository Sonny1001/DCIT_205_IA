        <p class="topic">Here are some of the topics you will come across when you enroll into our Web Development programme&#58;</p>


        <ol>
            <li>
                <h2>Information Security Fundamentals</h2>
                <p>
                    Information security is the practice of protecting information from unauthorized access, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. It involves implementing measures to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data.

                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h2>Penetration Testing</h2>
                <p>
                    Penetration testing, or ethical hacking, involves simulating real-world attacks on a system to identify and exploit vulnerabilities. This proactive approach helps organizations understand their security weaknesses and take corrective actions.
                </p>
            </li>
            
            <li>
                <h2>Firewalls</h2>
                <p>
                    Implement firewalls to monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic. Firewalls act as a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks, preventing unauthorized access and protecting against cyber threats.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h2>Encryption</h2>
                <p>
                    Use strong encryption algorithms to protect sensitive data during transmission and storage. This includes encrypting communications with protocols like HTTPS and ensuring that stored data is properly encrypted.

                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h2>Incident Response and Digital Forensics</h2>
                <p>
                    Having a well-defined incident response plan is crucial for quickly and effectively responding to security incidents. Digital forensics involves analyzing and recovering information from digital devices to investigate and prevent future incidents.
                </p>
            </li>
            
            <li>
                <h2>Blockchain Security</h2>
                <p>
                    As blockchain technology becomes more prevalent, understanding its security implications is crucial. This includes securing smart contracts, protecting against 51% attacks, and ensuring the integrity of distributed ledger systems.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h2>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)</h2>
                <p>
                    Implement MFA to add an extra layer of security beyond traditional username and password authentication. This typically involves using a combination of something you know (password) and something you have (e.g., a mobile device or security token).
                </p>
            </li>
            
            <li>
                <h2>Network Segmentation</h2>
                <p>
                    Divide networks into segments to restrict access to sensitive information. This limits the potential impact of a security breach and prevents lateral movement by attackers within the network.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h2>Honeypots</h2>
                <p>
                    Deploy honeypots, which are decoy systems designed to lure attackers. By analyzing the techniques used by attackers on honeypots, organizations can better understand potential threats and strengthen their defenses.
                </p>
            </li>
            
            <li>
                <h2>Endpoint Security</h2>
                <p>
                    Ensure the security of individual devices (endpoints) through measures such as antivirus software, endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions, and device management policies.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
