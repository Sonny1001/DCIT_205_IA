        <h1 class="intro">Computer Network Fundamentals</h1>
        <p class="topic">Here are some of the topics you will come across when you enroll into our Computer Network Fundamentals programme&#58;</p>


        <ol>
            <li>
                <h2>Introduction to Networking</h2>
                <p>
                    Understand the basics of computer networks, including the purpose of networking, different types of networks (LANs, WANs), and the importance of communication protocols.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h2>OSI Model</h2>
                <p>
                    Explore the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model, which breaks down network communication into seven layers. Each layer has a specific role, and understanding this model is crucial for troubleshooting and designing networks.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h2>TCP/IP Protocol Suite</h2>
                <p>
                    Gain a deep understanding of the TCP/IP protocol suite, which is the foundation of the internet. Learn about protocols like IP, TCP, UDP, ICMP, and how they enable communication between devices.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h2>IP Addressing</h2>
                <p>
                    Learn about IP addressing, subnetting, and the difference between IPv4 and IPv6. This includes understanding how devices on a network are uniquely identified using IP addresses.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h2>Routing and Switching</h2>
                <p>
                    Explore the principles of routing (moving data between different networks) and switching (connecting devices within the same network). Understand how routers and switches function and their role in directing data traffic.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h2>Network Troubleshooting</h2>
                <p>
                    Develop skills in troubleshooting common network issues, including connectivity problems, slow performance, and network errors. Learn how to use diagnostic tools effectively.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h2>IPv6 Implementation</h2>
                <p>
                    Understand the basics of IPv6, the next-generation internet protocol. Explore the differences between IPv4 and IPv6, and learn how to configure and manage IPv6 addresses. 
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h2>Quality of Service (QoS)</h2>
                <p>
                    Learn about QoS mechanisms that prioritize and manage network traffic to ensure optimal performance for critical applications.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h2>Wide Area Networks (WANs)</h2>
                <p>
                    Explore the principles of wide area networking, including different WAN technologies such as PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol), Frame Relay, and MPLS (Multiprotocol Label Switching).
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h2>VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks)</h2>
                <p>
                    Understand VLANs and how they enable the segmentation of a network into smaller, logically isolated segments. This enhances network security and management.

                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
